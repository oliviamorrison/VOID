### The Game
VOID is a game set on a planet in space. 
You are an astronaut that is slowly running out of oxygen.
The aim of the game is to reach your spaceship before your oxygen runs out so you can
keep exploring space!

However, there are different challenges that you must face before all your oxygen
runs out. There is a bomb that can only be diffused using the diffuser, a vending
machine that is locked with chains and has to be cut open using bolt cutters and 
then unlocked with a coin. 
The vending machine will dispense a potion that players must give to an alien
in order to befriend him and access your space ship

Players have a hold limit of only 1 item at a time, and can travel through portals
to access different rooms. Oxygen tanks can be picked up along the way to replenish your supply.

(Hint: The walls will sometimes hide items, rotate your view using A and D keys!)
